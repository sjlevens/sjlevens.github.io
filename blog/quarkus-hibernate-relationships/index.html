        <h1>Quarkus Panache/Hibernate/CRUD</h1>
        <h2>I lost my mind looking for tutorials</h2>
        <h3>So I am making my own</h3>
        <h4>List of technologies used</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Java 11 (openjdk version "11.0.11" 2021-04-20)</li>
          <li>Quarkus 2.0</li>
          <li>Hibernate</li>
          <li>Panache</li>
          <li>Resteasy</li>
          <li>Jackson</li>
          <li>PostgresQL</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What are we going to make</h4>
        <p>An endpoint that is connected to a PostgresQL DB</p>
        <p>This endpoint will allow CRUD operations of a few types of entities</p>
        <p>
          These entities will have relationships that are Many to One, One to Many, Many to Many and
          One to One
        </p>
        <h4>Why these technologies</h4>
        <p>
          They are new, interesting and actually really cool once you get the hang of how they work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Panache particularly is going to make this all really clean. Most of the tutorials I found
          were using PanacheBaseEntity but we will be using the full Panache power!
