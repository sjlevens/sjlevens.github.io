          I love building scalable, living projects that evolve with exploration and a natural
          curiousity. Starting out, I picture a real person I know using the tools I am creating and
          imagine their interactions.

          Coding from a young age in math class on my TI-84 Plus Calculator üßÆ, I built games that
          got shared around via cables to all my friends. That is when I discovered that interfaces
          can be awesome, or they can suck. I decided to build awesome.

        <h5>2020 -></h5>
        <p>
          Multiple clients, mutliple frontends. Bespoke work from scratch in many cases. Setting up
          enterprise level projects quickly and efficiently. Mostly working with real time
          websockets for data layers.
        </p>

        <h5>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Achievements</h5>
        <p>
          I am very proud of implementing <code>a11y</code>, as we were dealing with students from
          all kinds of backgrounds, accessibility and usability with screen readers/translation
          software was very important for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was also the first time I built an entire app from scratch and made all the
          architectural decisions. I believe I have set it up very well so any engineers coming
          after will find it easy to understand and work with.

          A simple functional programming library from basics. Derived completely from Reduce which
          only uses the for( of ) pattern for lists and for( in ) for objects. Everything else is in
          terms of reduce and basic arthmetic operators.
