          I love building scalable, living projects that evolve with exploration and a natural
          curiousity. Starting out, I picture a real person I know using the tools I am creating and
          imagine their interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coding from a young age in math class on my TI-84 Plus Calculator 🧮, I built games that
          got shared around via cables to all my friends. That is when I discovered that interfaces
          can be awesome, or they can suck. I decided to build awesome.
